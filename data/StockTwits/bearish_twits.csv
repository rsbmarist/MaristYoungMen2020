Apple sees $27 billion of market value wiped out amid the delayed reopening of its main Chinese iPhone plants

Ming-Chi Kuo, a reliable Apple analyst, had already slashed his forecast for iPhone shipments in the first quarter by 10%, citing the coronavirus outbreak for the sizable disruption.

Apple issued &quot;wider than usual&quot; guidance for its second quarter in its January 28 report, noting that uncertainties could harm device shipments if the coronavirus outbreak isn&#39;t contained in a timely fashion. Apple shares reached new highs following the report&#39;s release but have since fallen modestly as markets digest the outbreak&#39;s effect on global growth, supply chains, and future guidance.

Apple fined EUR25M by France&#39;s DGCCRF, Engadget reports Apple has been fined EUR25M, or $27.3M, by the DGCCRF, France&#39;s Competition and fraud body, for intentionally slowing the performance of older iPhones, Engadget&#39;s Daniel Cooper reports. Apple will pay the fine, and display a press release prominently on its French website, according to the report.

Coronavirus may bring tech supply chains to a halt, Barron&#39;s says The coronavirus is killing hundreds of people and sickening thousands more, and it is also disrupting the global tech supply chain, Eric Savitz writes in this week&#39;s edition of Barron&#39;s. For now, it is nearly impossible to measure coronavirus risk for companies like Apple (AAPL), which is probably more reliant on China for parts, production, and sales than any company not based there, the author notes.

Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives says that after the coronavirus outbreak has forced an extended shutdown of Apple&#39;s flagship Chinese Foxconn factory over the last few weeks, production was expected to begin tomorrow, February 10. However, media reports came out of China that the Chinese Authorities and public health officials have now further delayed opening the &quot;hearts and lungs&quot; of the iPhone manufacturing ecosystem until further notice. The analyst notes that once production and the supply chain starts back up, it will take roughly 1-2 weeks to get to full production. This production news out of China over the weekend will be a &quot;shock to the system&quot; and disrupt the supply chain further for Apple on both its core iPhone franchise and AirPods unit production, which is already facing a short supply heading into this week, he contended.

Please visit blog for full analysis and charts: https://tideinvestor.com/tide-indicators-analysis-8-february-2020/

The message that I am getting from these bullish fund flow is that the market correction this time might be a short one. However, I remain Bearish on the stock market as I require more confirmations from my Tide Indicators about the market reversal back to bullish. It is still not confirmed yet currently. My Tide Indicators on 22 February 2020 and 29 February 2020 will be key in affecting my trading plan if indeed a market reversal is confirmed.

For those who are planning to go Long, I will suggest to be patient in the meantime as it might not be the right time yet. Overall, I think there is still alot room for the bearish tide to continue the trend down.

This brings the global death toll to more than 490 victims. 

Authorities confirmed an additional 3,156 cases of the virus in Hubei, where more than 50 million people live, which brings the total number of cases in the epicenter of the outbreak to 16,678.

 A total of 12,627 patients have been hospitalized in the province, including 771 who are in critical condition, according to the health authority.

The global number of confirmed coronavirus cases is now well over 23,000."

So RBC Capital through Mahaney is hyping its own offering because:

1) RBC has received  high commissions from UBER&#39;s IPO.

2) RBC&#39;s clients have bought a lot of UBER&#39;s shares at the IPO price of $45, so RBC wants now to help its clients sell their shares and lock in significant profits."

PARIS, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Nearly 140 governments have agreed to launch a rewrite of decades-old cross-border tax rules for the digital age over the coming months, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation said on Friday.

The rise of Amazon , Facebook and Google has strained existing rules to the breaking point because big tech companies can book profits in low-tax countries like Ireland no matter where their customers are located.

&quot;The international community reaffirmed its commitment to reach a consensus-based long-term solution to the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy, and will continue working toward an agreement by the end of 2020&quot; the OECD said in a statement.

Trump called Pelosi a &quot;third-rate politician&quot; and the meeting in the White House deteriorated into a diatribe, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters.

Later, in remarks to reporters on Capitol Hill, Pelosi said that Trump actually called her a &quot;third-grade&quot; politician.

&quot;What we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown. Sad to say,&quot; Pelosi had said upon leaving.

Trump posted on Twitter on Wednesday night - &quot;Nervous Nancy&#39;s unhinged meltdown!&quot; with a photo of Pelosi standing up and pointing at him during the meeting.The Democrats exited the meeting complaining  üòÜü§£ü§™ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüëÄ LET&#39;S GO LOWER!!! #TRUMP frustrated $aapl $ba $ibm $stld"

This link has their prior quarterly earnings reports compared year-over-year. Profit margin has been improving in 2019 due to revenues falling slower than expenses are falling. IBM hasn&#39;t been the same since Warren Buffet sold off in 2017. There is a lot of competition with Google and Amazon and Microsoft and &quot;newer&quot; companies like Salesforce. I don&#39;t typically invest in companies whose revenues aren&#39;t growing.

Bearish,188614025,"$AMD $INTC PLEASE READ --- Gonna do some math so people can understand the scale between AMD and Intel. 

Intel has a book value of 17.11 per share 
Intel Outstanding shares 4,701,000,000
Total net assets for Intel 4,701,000,000 * 17.11 = $80,434,110,000

AMD has a book value of 2 per share
AMD Outstanding shares 1,064,000,000
Total net assets for AMD 1,064,000,000 * 2 = $2,128,000,000

so to compare AMD to Intel take 
net assets of Intel / net assets of AMD

$80,434,110,000/ $2,128,000,000 = 37.79

This means Intel is 37.79 times larger then AMD

now compare market caps

AMD Market Cap = 50B
Intel Market Cap = 250B

This means Intel is trading at 5 times AMD&#39;s current price

With this considered is AMD still a good buy considering the size relationship?"

From the last eanings: For 2020, the company estimated sales between $445.4 million and $451.8 million, while the EPS was forecast between -$0.65 and -$0.62.  
  
Cyber Security has a large competitive market also with mega companies like $CSCO (Cisco) or $MSFT (Microsoft).

This is the most mind blowing stupid move a company can do. Let&#39;s take on enormous new debt and buy back shares. Not to acquire a company, not to invest in R&amp;D and not to expand product line but to BUY BACK shares. 

Looks like Directors want a bump from buybacks so they can unload. Sooner or later the share price will fall when they ran out of BORROWED money to buy their own shares.
