AMD&#39;s upcoming Renoir Zen2 APUs could feature a Vega 12 iGPU, according to information from Komachi. Since the 7nm node affords accommodation of more cores, it is also being speculated that a Vega 15 iGPU is also highly probable. We don&#39;t know much about these upcoming APUs, but a proper memory implementation could seen them further widening the gap with the Iris Plus Graphics G7 and the NVIDIA GeForce MX250.

The 7nm Renoir APUs present an interesting paradigm. ... Another interesting possibility is that Renoir APUs can further widen the performance gap with the Intel Ice Lake Iris Plus G7 and also eclipse the NVIDIA GeForce MX250, but that depends a lot on the memory implementation and the available bandwidth.

February 05, 2020

‚ÄúDespite being only four years old, the Apple Watch has fundamentally changed the way we use technology. Due to the sheer number of Apple Watches now seen in the wild, those claiming the device is unpopular have been silenced. However, there continues to be a good amount of cynicism thrown at the computer found on 65 million wrists around the world. 

Many tech analysts and pundits continue to look at the Apple Watch as nothing more than an iPhone accessory - an extension to the smartphone that will never have the means or capability of being revolutionary. Such a view is misplaced as it ignores how the Apple Watch has already ushered in a paradigm shift in computing...‚Äù

Heard that when $AMD was $1.80, now 2,600% later, I am hearing the same losers say the same thing on just a small temporary stock price spike..

AMD stated that Q2-2020 will be sequentially lower than Q4-2019 because of seasonality and end-of-life products, and that this replacing  new products will return a large profit boom on H2-2020. 

Understand the latter or lose money in the long run..

Year-over-year, AMD profits were out of the park in profits.

AMD stock price will continue to go up to $100 within 2 years.. Intel has nothing to stop AMD, but AMD is destroying Intel profits at all product levels.

$INTC has no real competitive products until 2021/2022 if Intel ever delivers.. By that time AMD will be in its next generations of much more powerful architectures..

Intel will never enjoy its monopolistic 2x to 8x profits any more, so Intel will stagnate over the years

Intel CEO is an accountant with lots of dirty financial tricks under his sleeves.. He repurchases shares to pump up Intel EPS, buys/sells assets to be able to move money around, makes lots of fake announcements to impress and then they implode or change over time for tge worst, etc.

And Intel will not have secured chips, high number of cores, high-multi core performance, chiplets, 7 nm chips, etc.. until 2021+.."

CES 2020 is the biggest tech show of the year, and Intel just gave us vague teases of future products.

Instead, Intel wasted most of its time talking about smart cities, the Red Cross and football. This is all definitely cool and important work that Intel is doing, but I couldn&#39;t help but feel that Intel totally forgot that this was the Consumer Electronics Show. 

When Intel finally did get around to actually talking about products that matter for the average consumer, it only did so in vague teases.

It teased Tiger Lake, but didn&#39;t give any specific specs. 

It showed Destiny 2 running on a mobile-class Intel Xe discrete GPU, but didn&#39;t give any other information.

Before Intel even launches a discrete GPU, it has bled out two ex-RTG marketing staffers

($INTC GPU plans stink so much that key honest people are leaving, can&#39;t stand the stench)

By Anthony Garreffa on Nov 27, 2019 5:28 pm CST

Intel did a shady trick of having an NDA of their latest 10th-gen HEDT chips just before AMD&#39;s new Ryzen Threadripper 3950/3970X launched -- and then within a couple of days this news breaks out.

Chris Hook and Heather Lennon, former Radeon Technologies Group marketing staffers, have left Intel. In the last couple of years they both left the crumbling team of RTG where most of them found a new home at Intel, and now Hook and Lennon have left the odyssey. 

Given that Intel are really starting to see their wheels wobble in the consumer market with huge market share losses to their consumer and now HEDT processors, AMD is really putting the pressure on them.

Original Article:
Jon Peddie Research has released its Q2 2019 GPU market results, and it&#39;s official: AMD shipped more graphics unit than Nvidia for the first time in five years, thanks to AMD shipping almost 9.85% more GPUs than in Q1 (by comparison, Nvidia sold about the same). The market share data represents cumulative shipments of all types of desktop PC graphics units, including those present in processors, which is an area that Nvidia doesn&#39;t have a significant market presence.

Professional market players write covered calls to increase investment income, but individual investors can also benefit from this conservative but effective option strategy by taking the time to learn how it works and when to use it. You will have a known expectation on profit and many times downside protection up to 10%. The stress about knowing when to sell is eliminated. If you don&#39;t like Covered Calls, you don&#39;t have to respond with negative comments. We get it and understand. The bottom line is every investor has to have the CC in their knowledge base. 
We issue conservative CC&#39;s every day using high quality stocks that have neutral or bullish profiles. $ATVI, $GRUB. $WW and $INTC are just a few of many that we use time and time again. We are attaching an example using $JD. Check our profile if you want to learn more. (click diamond icon)"

Arya does not deny the threat that AMD poses to Intel. But neither has the market. Arya says potential additional share losses to AMD are already priced into Intel stock at this point. Fortunately, the size of the global computing market is expanding rapidly, and Arya says there is plenty of growth opportunity out there for multiple winners. 
Bank of America is projecting Intel‚Äôs unit share of the PC CPU market will drop from 84% to 83% through 2021. Arya is projecting Intel‚Äôs share of the server CPU market will drop from 95% to 90%. 
Arya says Wall Street is focusing on Intel losing market share in its traditional $50 billion CPU market. However, he says investors are not appreciating the fact that Intel‚Äôs new product offerings are growing its total addressable market to more than $200 billion. In other words, Intel may be getting a slightly smaller piece of a significantly larger pie."

Bullish,192482220,"@shane68 

Heard that when $AMD was $1.80, now 2,600% later, I am hearing the same losers say the same thing on just a small temporary stock price spike..

AMD stated that Q2-2020 will be sequentially lower than Q4-2019 because of seasonality and end-of-life products, and that this replacing  new products will return a large profit boom on H2-2020. 

Understand the latter or lose money in the long run..

Year-over-year, AMD profits were out of the park in profits.

AMD stock price will continue to go up to $100 within 2 years.. Intel has nothing to stop AMD, but AMD is destroying Intel profits at all product levels.

$INTC has no real competitive products until 2021/2022 if Intel ever delivers.. By that time AMD will be in its next generations of much more powerful architectures..

Intel will never enjoy its monopolistic 2x to 8x profits any more, so Intel will stagnate over the years

INTC stock pays a 2.1% dividend, which is impressive in itself within the tech sector. However, it‚Äôs the company‚Äôs extremely aggressive share buyback program that has Arya‚Äôs attention. Intel has authorized a $20 billion buyback program over the next six quarters, the largest program in the company‚Äôs history. Incredibly, that buyback represents roughly 7% of Intel‚Äôs entire market cap. 
Arya says the market is not fully appreciating just how huge this buyback program is. In addition to supporting earnings per share, the buybacks send an important message about management confidence. 
From 2015 to 2018, Intel‚Äôs buybacks averaged around 26% of the company‚Äôs free cash flow. The current program, however, represents about 70% of FCF. Investors who read between the lines see a management team that is much more confident about the future than they were a couple of years ago."

(This is a lot more interesting than Huawei trying to do this on its own. These four ‚Äì basically the four biggest Android handset OEMs after Samsung ‚Äì have more than 30% of the worldwide smartphone market, so about 40% of the Android market. That‚Äôs the sort of thing that could get Google‚Äôs attention, especially since they could put their own app store front and center (especially in Europe) to attract sales.)"

It truly seems as if AMD designed the new Ryzen microarchitecture with better security in mind than Intel‚Äôs essentially Nehalem-based microarchitectures have been. 

With the release of the new Zen architecture, AMD also seems to have been one step ahead of Intel in terms of supporting new hardware encryption features.... at least for now, AMD seems to have the lead.

Even ignoring all the various performance slowdowns the Spectre-related patches have caused for both old and new systems alike, AMD‚Äôs processors seem like the safer and more secure platform to choose in the near and medium-term.

(With $AMD stock gaining 2,100%  over the last 3 years, sonce February 2016 it was $1.80.. on initial stock recovery only, $AMD will go $200+ in high-performance product profit run.. Like Nvidia who went from $30 to $250  in around 3 years.)

The company just achieved a new record for its sales at Germany&#39;s largest retailer: Mindfactory.de. Clawing even more market share from Intel, the company clocked in at 82% of total CPU sales in November 2019, up from 78% in October. The market share increase was led primarily by the Ryzen R7 3700X and R5 3600X processors.

In terms of total revenue, AMD processors accounted for 77% of all processors sold due to a lower ASP  than their Intel counterparts while Intel clocked in at 23%. $AMD clocked in at 82% representing more than 25000 processors sold during the month of November while Intel CPUs shipped in an average quantity of ~5000.

Intel publishes misleading benchmark

Given the heat that Intel is facing with a resurgent AMD, to say nothing of their own difficulties across the product line as the transition to 10nm has been a protracted, years-long problem form the firm, the &quot;Performance at Intel&quot; blog has been caught red-handed by Patrick Kennedy at STH for publishing a GROMACS benchmark claiming that a two-socket Xeon 9282 system is 20% faster than a two-socket EPYC 7742 system.

AMD does not need to charge 2x to 8x higher monopolistic prices to their customers, like Intel has done for years. Intel loses 2x to 8x profits for every product they don&#39;t sell because if AMD..

AMD chiplet manufacturing cost a fraction of Intel&#39;s obsoleted monolithic manufacturing..

Intel key areas product profits are now disappearing at all product levels.. It will not be too long before Intel will not be able to hide its large profit loses during earnings.

Looking FORWARD (because that what markets do) NAND pricing already bottomed and memory pricing is bottoming right now. The future is bright. In the 2021-2022 timeframe, $MU could have around $58B in annual revenue (about 8x as much as $AMD) and about $4 to $6 EPS per quarter.

Netflix, a household name in the online streaming industry appears to be evaluating AMD EPYC based solutions for its data centers as a possible replacement for Intel Xeon based solutions.

What it will all boil down to, however, is how the switching costs come into play. Since AMD is currently offering better performance for the same TCO, the only thing Netflix has to worry about is the cost associated with shifting from an Intel ecosystem to an AMD one. Considering AMD&#39;s latest generation EPYC parts are shipping with PCIe 4, we feel that the company has a distinct upper hand when it comes to tech and we wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Netflix decides to make the shift eventually. Needless to say, Intel should start paying attention to Netflix&#39;s future plans post-haste if they want to retain this big client

McAfee called it a ‚Äúwatershed moment for AMD,‚Äù where new chips like the Ryzen 7 4800U will offer 8 cores vs. Ice Lake‚Äôs 4 cores. ‚Äú... having more cores helps them do whatever it is they want to,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúHaving more cores just gives you more flexibility.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll feel the responsiveness...you‚Äôll feel the ability to do more with that processor,‚Äù McAfee promised.

Another thing users should notice are the laptops themselves (several were announced at CES), generally more premium in features and build quality than in prior generations of AMD mobile offerings. Dell‚Äôs G5 15 SE gaming laptop is one example, and another is the Asus ROG G14. They‚Äôre surprisingly thin, too, given the heft of the 8-core CPU.

Bullish,189520156,"&quot;2019 was huge for AMD. Dr. Lisa Hsu says that 2020 will be even bigger&quot;

(Here comes AMD stock $100 in 2020 or within 2 years. AMD&#39;s market share growing as fast as chios can be manufactured. And, AMD is now the biggest TSMC client )

First up is what Lisa Hsu calls the best laptop processor, the Mobile Ryzen 4000. The first 7nm x86 mobile. The ultra-low volt version packs 8 Zen2 cores AND 8 Radeon cores using the Vega architecture, and packs it all into a 15-watt envelope, in spite of a 4.2 GHz peak clock speed.

Dr. Hsu showed one of the first laptops using this ULV processor, an impressively thin Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 that‚Äôs 15mm thick. Packing eight cores into such a compact form factor is quite an accomplishment.

With over 100 laptops in the works using Ryzen 4000, it‚Äôs evident that as predicted the Surface design win was just AMD‚Äôs first foot in the door for the mobile market.

AMD unveiled the highly anticipated 64 128 thread core 3990x priced at $3990.

I don&#39;t need to convince any non-technology savvy  chartologist or investor

I am an individual investor with a goal of making large profits.  AMD has been by far the best and fastest investment over my last 40 years in technology stocks.. together with nvidia  apple, etc.

Any individual investors  who have AMD stocks have made up to 25x profits on their investments in just 3 years.. $INTC  only 0.8x profits in 3 years..

If you are not making large profits in stocks is because you are not investing in one of S&amp;P 500 best investment stocks which is AMD.. and AMD is widely recognized by the investment community..

Intel is being pump up by Intel proxies investment companies and analysts for hire to get rid of the stock before it collapses

AMD is going to follow Nvidia&#39;s profit run from $30 to $250+. AMD has the perfect blend of multiple high end technologies to dominate the cpu, gpu, hybrid cpu/gpu, etc. multi-million TAMs"

Arya says Intel‚Äôs relatively new management team appears determined to better manage spending. By exiting low-value activities, being smarter with external partnerships and reducing operating expenses to 25% of revenue, Arya says Intel can help offset rising capital expenses. 
Bank of America recently met with Intel CFO George Davis. Arya says Davis and his team are adamant about cost discipline. At the same time, cost cutting can shore up margins. Arya says Intel also has the chance to leverage its pricing power. In fact, even though AMD is providing fierce competition, Intel raised its average data center sale prices (ASP) by 9% in the third quarter. Its PC ASP was also up more than 3%"

Bank of America says INTC stock will shine in 2020 
1. Industry Outperformance 
2. Cost-Cutting and Pricing Opportunities 
3. Aggressive Capital Returns 
4. AMD Threat Priced In 
5. INTC Stock Is a Compelling Value 
As a value investor at heart, this argument speaks to me most. INTC stock trades at a forward earnings multiple of just 12.7, more than a 30% discount to peers. In addition, Arya says Intel stock is both underweighted by U.S. fund managers and buy-rated by just 39% of analysts covering the stock."

Intel profit scheme is now completely broken, no matter how much money Intel is spending to keep the OEMs from fully buying and delivering high end AMD based products

Intel used to charge its customers 2x to 8x more for its products.. Not any more.. and any OEMs selling overpriced Intel systems will go the SGI dodo way

AMD is now ruling servers,  consumer, prosumer, embedded,  supercomputers,  will soon release its 4000 APU series in a couple of days. These will be used in powerfull small form factors computers and Intel will not have anything until 2021+++

AMD is making some big promises. The company claims that the 4800U, the highest-end U series chip, beats the recently launched Intel Core i7-1065G7 in singled-threaded performance by up to 4%. 

It claims multi-threaded performance is up to 90% higher, thanks to double the core count. Graphics performance is up to 18% better.

For the 4800H, the highest-end H series chip, AMD claims a 5% single-threaded advantage and a 46% multi-threaded advantage over Intel&#39;s i7-9750H processor. 

The 4800H will also deliver 25% faster 4K video encoding and 39% better gameplay physics and simulation

The first Ryzen 4000 mobile devices will arrive in the first quarter, and more than 100 devices are set to hit the market this year

The $AMD Ryzen 9 3950X has scored 34,009 points in the PassMark - CPU Mark benchmark. The score is faster than $INTC entire HEDT lineup. Even their 28 core, 56 thread Xeon W-3175X has a lower score of 33,538 points than AMD&#39;s flagship mainstream chip. 

That&#39;s comparing a $749 US with a $2999 US processor. $AMD has stated that the Ryzen 9 3950X will be the most powerful 16 core desktop processor in the world at launch and it explains why $INTC didn&#39;t include a 16 core option of their own in their HEDT lineup.

So how did Intel go from the leader of the HEDT space to being crushed by AMD&#39;s mainstream chip platform? You are expecting me to blame Intel&#39;s reliance on 14nm for this issue and while it is a factor, it isn&#39;t as big as some other bad decisions that went into Intel&#39;s HEDT lineup starting with the 7th Generation Core-X series.

Intel To Skip 10nm For Desktop CPUs, Will Offer 7nm Desktop CPUs in 2022

&quot;The report says that Intel&#39;s 10nm supply just isn&#39;t enough to handle mass markets such as desktop at the moment which is why they will be offering 14nm replacements up till 2022. &quot; 

And HP desktop and workstations profits are going to the toilet, too, since they are an $$INTC shop and always offer shitty $AMD products with poor configurations.. A pitty.. I used to buy from HP for so many years..

Intel will need to inject a lot of fake marketing and investing fake news to try to keep Intel stock price from imploding.. Intel is being massively overrun in every area by AMD..

Bullish,192800374,"Here is the big picture on $AMZN    (hint: it&#39;s bullish as hell)

We&#39;ve been trading basically sideways for just under 2 years. 

Today, we&#39;re likely going to close over a resistance we&#39;ve been unable to close over for years. 

AMZN has been dead money for awhile. When a stock trades sideways, it builds up energy. It&#39;s really just resting 

Similarly to the sideways action we saw early 2017 (pictured on chart) where we subsequently broke over resistance and headed much higher. Just like today

So now that we&#39;ve had almost 2 years to rest, now we have a ton of built up energy for a massive move higher. 

I think 3,000 is a very likely target by the end of 2020. 

This was already our largest individual stock holding coming into today and if/when we close over 2050, we&#39;ll add to the position. 

Highly likely that this propels the rest of the market much much higher as well $SPX $SPY $QQQ $DIA

In the future, a pair of eyeglasses will be able to add visual context to our surroundings. 

In each example, we have a fundamental rethink of how people use computers to improve their lives. The ‚Äútraining wheels,‚Äù or early technological bonds that may exist in the early reiterations of these devices should not be taken or viewed as permanent chains.

And that&#39;s not all. Alibaba is the leader of China&#39;s cloud computing market with a 47% market share. These numbers indicate Alibaba&#39;s success in growing its cloud computing business compared to Alphabet.

As if leadership in e-commerce and cloud computing weren&#39;t enough, Alibaba also leads advertising in the China market. This makes sense since Alibaba ties advertising to its e-commerce business by offering merchants the opportunity to pay for higher placement on its websites."

Bullish,184033781,"To answer your comment Quig16, for $TCEHY or $GOOGL or $MSFT or $BABA to buyout $SOGO it would have to go through Sohu, who mainly exists to keep  Sogou as an independent Technology company. Charles Zhang (CEO of Sohu) is the only insider who has sold shares in Sogou, in order to buy shares in Sohu, in order to protect from a takeover. In January 2019, Sohu named their price for their 130M shares of Sogou. Their poison pill stipulated $200M per share for the 39M or so shares of Sohu, where a company then could discard Sohu and sell off CYOU, but then gain the 130M shares of Sogou. 
  
If you do the math, Charles Zhang essentially named his price: $7.8B for Sohu&#39;s shares in Sogou. Per share, this is $60 for every share that Sohu owns of Sogou.   
  
This can happen any quarter, any month, any week, any day.   
  
To be honest, the $60 price is a bargain. If Tencent approved Sogou Search monetization within WeChat, the net income generated would propel Sogou over $30B in market cap."
